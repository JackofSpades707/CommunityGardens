    Description)
    A community garden driven by volunteer's which can be any shape/size
    Each garden has it's own table in the database representing all it's ranges
    Planting Volunteers approach Primary Admin Volunteer before starting to get initiate credit earning process (This happens once)
    Planting Volunteers approach Primary Admin Volunteer before leaving area to end credit earning process
    Primary Admin Volunteer assigns picture & range # to a Planting Volunteer
    Every X amount of ZxZ feet = 1 range (With a sign phsyically identifying the range #)
    1 Admin Volunteer per range with a GUI representing all Planting Volunteers & their stats within range

    Technicalities)
        Virtual Representation of Facility:
            - Database of tables, each table == 1 virtual facility representing 1 physical facility's ranges
            - Each range # identifies all volunteer's working within that range
            - 2 Labor types (Planting Volunteers Work & Admin Volunteers Work)
            - Modifiers for Admin Volunteers Work based off tier
            - Planting Volunteers rewarded based off amount of work done
            - Admin Volunteers rewarded based off of time worked
            - Anyone can perform lower-tier work
            - Always 1 Primary Admin Volunteer per location
            - Always 1 Admin Volunteer per range #

    Volunteer tiers)
        1) Planting Volunteers - Plant/Maintain/harvest functions
        2) Admin Volunteers - Regulatory & operation functions
        3) Primary Admin Volunteer - 1 per physical site, Handles physical badges & oversee's Admin Volunteers
        4) Primary Admin Volunteer++ - Same as previous Primary Admin Volunteer, but able too request implementation of addional physical sites to be virtually implemented

    Problem)
        - How to define & regulate how people aquire credits to prevent gaming the system & reward people fairly
        - Higher tier volunteer's should on average earn more than lower tier volunteer's

    Solution)
        - Virtual Badges avaliable for everyone via app (Everyone has a unique badge ID)
        - Some onsite physical badges
        - Badge scanner is built into the app
        - Credits are avaliable in 2 forms, authorized and unauthorized
        - Admin Volunteers verify credits (convert unauthorized credits into authorized credits)
        - Admin Volunteers are awarded credits by time
        - All Admin Volunteers have a GUI view of all badges working within their range #
        - Admin Volunteers can easily replace picture associated with a physical badge ID
        - Planting Volunteers apply unauthorized credits after performing an action
